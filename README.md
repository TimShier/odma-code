Dear Ogilvy class!

First off, welcome to the geeky depths of Github.

Please feel free to navigate to the correct section and use this to get a up-to-date version of the code as I work through it.

Cheers,

PS: if you want to get seriously geeky... try install Git on your machine and pull this repository to your own machine.
